            <h2>Who we are</h2>
            <p>Hack With Me is a high-school hackathon — the largest in-person high-school hackathon in Rwanda and across Africa. We organize a flagship 24-hour coding event each year, where students form teams, build real projects, learn from mentors, and showcase their work. In addition to the main edition, we sometimes host smaller ‘half-editions’ to keep the community active and give students more chances to collaborate.</p>

          <div className="privacy-section">
            <h2>What we collect</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Site basics</strong>: standard server logs (IP address, user agent) kept briefly by our hosting to keep the site reliable and secure.</li>
              <li><strong>Emails</strong>: if you contact us at <a href="mailto:info@hackwithme.org">info@hackwithme.org</a>, we receive your email address and message.</li>
              <li><strong>Donations/Sponsorship</strong>: if you donate or sponsor through third‑party platforms (e.g., Hack Club Bank), those providers process your details and share only what we need for receipts and compliance.</li>
              <li><strong>Event registration</strong>: if sign‑ups are handled through an external ticketing tool, your data is processed by that provider first. We receive only the fields required to run the event (e.g., name, email).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Cookies and analytics</h2>
            <p>We do not use advertising cookies and we don’t run invasive trackers. If we use a basic visit counter, it will be minimal and only for aggregate stats. You can block cookies in your browser.</p>

            <h2>How we use information</h2>

            <h2>Sharing</h2>
            <p>We don’t sell personal data. We share limited information with trusted service providers only when needed to operate the event or process donations. These providers must handle your data responsibly.</p>

          <div className="privacy-section">
            <h2>Retention</h2>
            <p>We keep information only as long as needed for the reasons above—then delete it or anonymize it.</p>

          <div className="privacy-section">
            <h2>Minors</h2>
            <p>Hack With Me is for high‑school students. We limit what we collect and communicate clearly with participants and guardians when required by school or venue policy.</p>
